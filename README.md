# Deep Learning Models for Petroleum Derivatives Sales Forecasting

---

## Description

This repository gathers the codes and results from experiments conducted using various **deep learning models** applied to forecasting petroleum derivatives sales. The analyzed models include:  

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
- **N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis Time Series)**  
- **Time-MoE (Time Mixture of Experts)**  
- **LagLlama**  

Each model is organized in its own directory, with specific and well-documented codes to ensure easy navigation and understanding by users.  

In addition, detailed analyses of the results obtained during the experiments are available in the file `analysis_of_results.ipynb`. This notebook provides:  
- Charts illustrating patterns and predictions made by the models;  
- Metrics evaluating the performance of each approach;  
- Detailed comparisons between the utilized models.  

**Note:** This repository **does not include saved models**, only the codes and analyses performed.

## Requirements and Instructions

1. **Dependencies**  
   Ensure you install all the necessary libraries and dependencies before running the notebooks or scripts. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.  

2. **Model Execution**  
   Each model has a specific set of instructions available in its corresponding directory. Refer to the individual README files for detailed information about:  
   - Environment setup;  
   - Expected data structure;  
   - Adjustable parameters;  
   - Steps for training and validation.  

3. **Results Analysis**  
   Use the `analysis_of_results.ipynb` notebook to explore the experimental results. It includes visualizations and analyses that can be tailored to the user's needs.
