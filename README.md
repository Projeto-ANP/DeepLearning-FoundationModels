# Deep Learning and Foundation Models for Petroleum Derivatives Sales Forecasting

---

## Description

This repository gathers the code and results from experiments conducted using various **deep learning models** and some **foundation models** applied to the forecasting of petroleum derivatives sales. The analyzed models include:

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
- **N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis Time Series)**  
- **Time-MoE (Time Mixture of Experts)**  
- **TimesFM**  
- **Morai**  

Each model is organized in its own directory, with specific and documented codes to ensure easy navigation and understanding.  

In addition, detailed analyses of the results obtained during the experiments are available in the file `analysis_of_results.ipynb`. This notebook provides:  
- Charts illustrating patterns and predictions made by the models;  
- Metrics evaluating the performance of each approach;  
- Detailed comparisons between the utilized models.  

**Note:** This repository **does not include saved models**, only the codes and analyses performed.

## Requirements and Instructions

1. **Dependencies**  
   Ensure you install all the necessary libraries and dependencies before running the notebooks or scripts. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.  

2. **Model Execution**  
   Each model has a specific set of instructions available in its corresponding directory. Refer to the individual README files for detailed information about:  
   - Environment setup;  
   - Expected data structure;  
   - Adjustable parameters;  
   - Steps for training and validation.  

3. **Results Analysis**  
   Use the `analysis_of_results.ipynb` notebook to explore the experimental results. It includes visualizations and analyses that can be tailored to the user's needs.
